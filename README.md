### Create Table

```sql
CREATE TABLE table_name (
    name_field VARCHAR(100),
    description_field TEXT,
    status_field ENUM('pending', 'in-progress', 'done'),
    yearly_salary INT,
    exact_decimal_field DECIMAL(10,2),
    approximate_decimal_field FLOAT,
    only_date_field DATE,
    date_with_time_field TIMESTAMP,
    boolean_field BOOLEAN,
    json_field JSON
);
```

### Table with Default Values

```sql
CREATE TABLE table_name (
    name_field VARCHAR(100) DEFAULT 'Unnamed',
    description_field TEXT DEFAULT 'No description provided',
    status_field ENUM('pending', 'in-progress', 'done') DEFAULT 'pending',
    yearly_salary INT DEFAULT 50000,
    exact_decimal_field DECIMAL(10,2) DEFAULT 0.00,
    approximate_decimal_field FLOAT DEFAULT 0.0,
    only_date_field DATE DEFAULT CURRENT_DATE,
    date_with_time_field TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    boolean_field BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
    json_field JSON DEFAULT (JSON_OBJECT('initialized', true)),
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

### Insert Data into Table

**Note:** Field names are optional in INSERT queries. If omitted, values must be provided in the same order as defined in the table structure.

```sql
-- With field names (recommended for clarity)
INSERT INTO table_name (name_field, description_field, status_field, yearly_salary, exact_decimal_field, approximate_decimal_field, only_date_field, date_with_time_field, boolean_field, json_field)
VALUES ('John Doe', 'Senior Software Engineer with 5 years of experience', 'in-progress', 85000, 123.456, 72.5, '2023-12-25', '2023-12-25 14:30:00', true, '{"skills": ["Python", "JavaScript"], "level": "senior"}');

-- Without field names (values must match table column order)
INSERT INTO table_name
VALUES ('John Doe', 'Senior Software Engineer with 5 years of experience', 'in-progress', 85000, 123.456, 72.5, '2023-12-25', '2023-12-25 14:30:00', true, '{"skills": ["Python", "JavaScript"], "level": "senior"}');
```

### Delete Table

```sql
-- Delete single table without confirmation
DROP TABLE table_name;

-- Delete single table only if it exists (prevents error if table doesn't exist)
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS table_name;

-- Delete multiple tables at once
DROP TABLE table1, table2, table3;

-- Delete multiple tables if they exist
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS table1, table2, table3;
```

### Modify Table

```sql
-- Add column(s)
ALTER TABLE table_name
    ADD COLUMN field1 INT,
    ADD COLUMN field2 VARCHAR(50);

-- Modify column data type
ALTER TABLE table_name
    MODIFY COLUMN field_name VARCHAR(200);

-- Change column name and type
ALTER TABLE table_name
    CHANGE old_field_name new_field_name VARCHAR(100);

-- Drop column
ALTER TABLE table_name
    DROP COLUMN field_name;

-- Rename table
RENAME TABLE old_table_name TO new_table_name;
```

## NULL vs 0

In MySQL, NULL represents an unknown or missing value, while 0 is a specific numeric value.

```sql
-- Table with NULL and 0 values
CREATE TABLE student_scores ( id INT, score INT );
INSERT INTO student_scores VALUES  (1, 80), (2, 0), (3, NULL), (4, 90);

-- Average calculation:
SELECT  AVG(score) as average_with_nulls FROM student_scores;
```

Results:

- `average_with_nulls`: 56.67 (170/3, NULL ignored and 0 considered)

## Constraints

| Constraint     | Description                                            |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| NOT NULL       | Ensures column cannot have NULL value                  |
| UNIQUE         | Ensures all values in column are different             |
| PRIMARY KEY    | `NOT NULL` + `UNIQUE`, Uniquely identifies each record |
| FOREIGN KEY    | Links two tables together                              |
| CHECK          | Ensures values meet specific conditions                |
| DEFAULT        | Sets default value for column                          |
| AUTO_INCREMENT | Automatically increments value                         |

```sql
-- Column level constraints
CREATE TABLE table_name (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    phone_no INT NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE,
    percentage_value INT DEFAULT 100 CHECK (percentage_value > 0 AND percentage_value < 101),
    department_id INT REFERENCES departments_table(id)
);

-- Table level constraints
CREATE TABLE table_name (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT,
    phone_no INT NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(100),
    percentage_value INT DEFAULT 100,
    department_id INT,
    CONSTRAINT pk_user PRIMARY KEY (id),
    CONSTRAINT uk_email UNIQUE (email),
    CONSTRAINT percent_value_constraint CHECK (percentage_value > 0 AND percentage_value  < 101),
    CONSTRAINT fk_dept FOREIGN KEY (department_id) REFERENCES departments_table(id)
);
```

## Text Encoding and Collation

| Text Encoding                                     | Text Collation                                          |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Which Characters are supported and can be stored. | How Characters are compared.                            |
| Ex: 't', '6', 'á¹»', 'ðŸ¤š'                           | EX: 'u' < 'á¹»'                                           |
| Not all encodings support all characters          | Different collations control character comparison order |
| `utf8mb4` is recommended text encoding            | `utf8mb4_unicode_ci` is recommended collation           |
| Encoding can be set at column and table level     | Collation can be set at column and table level          |

## Create Table from Another Table

```sql
-- Create new table with same structure and data
CREATE TABLE new_table AS
    SELECT * FROM table_name;

-- Create new table with same structure but no data
CREATE TABLE new_table AS
    SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE 1=0;

-- Create new table with specific fields
CREATE TABLE new_employees AS
    SELECT name_field, yearly_salary, status_field FROM table_name WHERE yearly_salary > 60000;
```

## Temporary Table

Temporary tables exist only for the current session and are automatically dropped when the session ends.

```sql
-- Create temporary table
CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE temp_high_salary_employees (emp_id INT, name VARCHAR(100), salary DECIMAL(10,2));

-- Insert data from main table
INSERT INTO temp_high_salary_employees
    SELECT id, name_field, yearly_salary FROM table_name WHERE yearly_salary > 75000;

-- Use temporary table for complex calculations
SELECT AVG(salary) as avg_high_salary FROM temp_high_salary_employees;
```

Use cases:

- Complex queries requiring multiple steps
- Storing intermediate results

## Generated Column

```sql
CREATE TABLE employees (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    first_name VARCHAR(50),
    last_name VARCHAR(50),
    full_name VARCHAR(101) GENERATED ALWAYS AS (CONCAT(first_name, ' ', last_name)) STORED,
    full_name_reversed VARCHAR(101) GENERATED ALWAYS AS (CONCAT(last_name, ', ', first_name)) VIRTUAL
);

INSERT INTO employees (first_name, last_name) VALUES ('John', 'Doe');

-- full_name and full_name_reversed are automatically generated
SELECT * FROM employees;
```

Note:

- STORED: Generated value is stored in the table (while inserting values)
- VIRTUAL: Generated value is calculated when queried (while fetching values) (**Default**)

## Data Manipulation (CRUD)

### Create (Insert Data)

```sql
-- Insert a single row with column names specified
INSERT INTO employees (first_name, last_name, email, salary)
VALUES ('John', 'Doe', 'john.doe@example.com', 60000);

-- Insert a single row without specifying column names (must match table structure order)
INSERT INTO employees 
VALUES (NULL, 'Jane', 'Smith', 'jane.smith@example.com', 65000);

-- Insert multiple rows in a single command
INSERT INTO employees (first_name, last_name, email, salary)
VALUES 
    ('Alice', 'Johnson', 'alice.j@example.com', 55000),
    ('Bob', 'Williams', 'bob.w@example.com', 70000),
    ('Carol', 'Davis', 'carol.d@example.com', 62000);

-- Insert data from another table (using SELECT)
INSERT INTO employee_archive (first_name, last_name, email, salary)
SELECT first_name, last_name, email, salary FROM employees WHERE termination_date IS NOT NULL;
```

### Read (Select Data)

```sql
-- Fetch all columns and all rows
SELECT * FROM employees;

-- Fetch specific columns
SELECT first_name, last_name, salary FROM employees;

-- Fetch with calculated fields
SELECT first_name, last_name, salary, salary * 0.1 AS bonus FROM employees;

-- Fetch with WHERE conditions
SELECT * FROM employees 
WHERE department = 'Engineering' AND (salary > 70000 OR experience_years > 5);
```

### Update

```sql
-- Update a single record
UPDATE employees SET salary = 65000 WHERE employee_id = 101;

-- Update multiple fields
UPDATE employees SET  salary = 75000, last_updated = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE employee_id = 102;

-- Update multiple records
UPDATE employees SET salary = salary * 1.1 WHERE department = 'Sales' AND performance_rating > 8;
```

### Delete

```sql
-- Delete a single record
DELETE FROM employees WHERE employee_id = 103;

-- Delete multiple records with single command
DELETE FROM employees WHERE department = 'Marketing' AND hire_date < '2020-01-01';

-- Delete all records from a table
DELETE FROM temp_log_entries;
-- OR (faster for large tables, resets AUTO_INCREMENT)
TRUNCATE TABLE temp_log_entries;
```

### Sorting/Ordering results (ORDER BY)
```sql
-- sort selected data in ascending order
SELECT * FROM <table>
    ORDER BY <column_name>;
```

```sql
-- sort selected data in descending order
SELECT * FROM <table>
    ORDER BY <column_name> DESC;
```

### LIMIT:
```sql
-- Select first x number of rows
SELECT * FROM <table>
    LIMIT <x>;
```

### OFFSET:
```sql
-- Select x number of rows after y number of rows (Used in pagination)
SELECT * FROM <table>
    LIMIT <x>
    OFFSET <y>;
```

### DISTINCT:
```sql
-- remove duplicate field values from result set
SELECT DISTINCT <field> FROM <table>;
```

### Subqueries and Views
```sql
SELECT customer_name, product_name FROM 
    (SELECT * FROM sales WHERE volume > 1000) AS base_result;

-- We can write above using View

CREATE VIEW base_result AS SELECT * FROM sales WHERE volume > 1000;
SELECT customer_name, product_name FROM base_result;
```

### Filtering using WHERE
Note: operators in where: =, !=, >, >=, <, <=, AND, OR, BETWEEN, IS, IS NOT.
(IS & IS NOT is used for NULL, TRUE, ...etc EX: IS NULL)

#### 1) Create Sales Table

```sql
CREATE TABLE sales (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,

### Normalization

- Data normalization is the process of organizing data in a database to minimize **redundancy** and **dependency**. The goal of normalization is to ensure that the data is stored in the most efficient way while maintaining data integrity.
- Key concepts:
    - **Redundancy:** Repetition of data, which can lead to inconsistencies and inefficiencies.
    - **Dependency:** The relationship between data fields in a database. If some pieces of data depend on others, they should be stored in a way that reflects that relationship.
    - **Normalization Levels:** There are several "normal forms" (1NF, 2NF, 3NF, etc.), each with stricter rules to reduce redundancy and dependencies.

| Normal Form | Rules/Criteria | Purpose |
| ----------- | -------------- | ------- |
| **1st Normal Form (1NF)** | 	1. **Atomicity**: Each column must contain atomic (indivisible) values. This means no lists or sets in a column. <br /> 2. **Uniqueness**: Each row must be unique. | Eliminate repeating groups and ensure the table has atomic values (no multi-valued columns). |
| **2nd Normal Form (2NF)** | 	1. **Be in 1NF**. <br /> 2. **Remove Partial Dependency**: No non-key column should depend on only part of a composite primary key (i.e., if the primary key consists of more than one column, all non-key attributes must depend on the whole key, not just part of it). | Eliminate redundancy caused by partial dependency in composite keys. |
| **3rd Normal Form (3NF)** | 1. **Be in 2NF**. <br /> 2. **Remove Transitive Dependency**: Non-key columns should not depend on other non-key columns. All non-key columns should depend only on the primary key. | Remove transitive dependencies between non-key attributes. |
| **Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF)** | 1. **Be in 3NF**. <br /> 2. Every **determinant** (attribute that determines another attribute) must be a **candidate key**. In other words, if a non-prime attribute (non-key attribute) determines another attribute, the determinant must be a candidate key. | Resolve issues not handled by 3NF, especially with respect to candidate keys. |
| **4th Normal Form (4NF)** | 1. **Be in BCNF**. <br /> 2. **Remove Multivalued Dependency**: If a table has two or more independent and multivalued facts about an entity, separate them into different tables. | Eliminate multivalued dependencies. |
| **5th Normal Form (5NF)** | 1. **Be in 4NF**. <br /> 2. **Remove Join Dependency**: A table should not contain any join dependency, i.e., it should be decomposable into smaller tables without loss of data. | Eliminate redundancy caused by join dependencies. |
| **Domain-Key Normal Form (DKNF)** | The table is free of all kinds of anomalies, and every constraint is a logical consequence of domain constraints (the set of valid values for a column) and key constraints (the relationships among primary and foreign keys). | Ensure the table is free from all anomalies (constraints apply directly). |

### Foreign key constraints ( ON DELETE & ON UPDATE )

| Constraint | Use Case |
| :--: | :--: |
| RESTRICT | Prevent the action (e.g. deleting a related row) |
| NO ACTION | Prevent the action (e.g. deleting a related row)<br>*(Check can be different)* |
| CASCADE | Perform the same action on the row with the foreign key |
| SET NULL | Set foreign key value to NULL if the related row was deleted |
| SET DEFAULT | Set foreign key value to DEFAULT value if the related row was deleted |

### Connecting two tables (Primary key + Foreign key)

<table>
<tr><th>addresses</th><th>users</th></tr>

<tr><td>

| id |  street  | house_number |
| -- |  ------- | -------------|
| 1 | first street | 5 |
| 2 | second street | 12 |
| 3 | third street | 4 |

</td><td>

| id |  first_name  | address_id |
| -- |  ------- | -------------|
| 1 | John | 2 |
| 2 | Michael | 1 |
| 3 | Rakesh | 3 |

</td></tr>
</table>

```sql
CREATE TABLE addresses (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    street VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    house_number VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL
);

-- If we don't use "(id)" then it will take the primary key of the table as a reference key
CREATE TABLE users (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT
    first_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    address_id INT REFERENCES addresses (id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);
-- Note: CASCADE => If I delete address having id 1, then it will delete user that has address_id 1
```

### Data Relationships (One to One, One to Many, Many to Many)

**Example:** Database of Company which contains below tables.
- **Employees:** id, first_name, last_name, email, team_id
- **Teams:** id, name, building_id
- **Projects:** id, title
- **Internet Accounts:** id, email, password
- **Buildings:** id, name

**One to One (1:1):**
- One record in Table A belongs to exactly one record in Table B.
- EX:
    - **employees - internet_accounts** (One employee has only one internet account)

**One to Many (1:n):**
- One record in Table A has one or many related records in Table B.
- Ex:
    - **employees - teams** (one team can have multiple employees)
    - **teams - buildings** (one building can have multiple teams)

**Many to Many (n:n):**
- One record in Table A has one or many related records in Table B and vice versa.
- It requires junction table to connect two tables.
- Ex:
    - **employees and projects** (There are multiple employees working on single project and one employee can also be working on multiple projects)

```sql
CREATE TABLE buildings (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE teams (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    building_id INT REFERENCES buildings (id) ON DELETE SET NULL
);

CREATE TABLE employees (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    first_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    last_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    team_id INT DEFAULT 1 REFERENCES teams (id) ON DELETE SET DEFAULT
);

CREATE TABLE internet_accounts (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE REFERENCES employees (email) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    password VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE projects (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    title VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL
);

-- Intermediate table => n:n

-- Wrong way XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
CREATE TABLE employees_projects (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    employee_id INT REFERENCES employees (id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    project_id INT REFERENCES projects (id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);

-- In above relation there may be duplicate entries in employees_projects table
-- Ex:
-- id | employee_id | project_id
-- 1  |      25     |     1
-- 2  |      25     |     1

CREATE TABLE employees_projects (
    employee_id INT REFERENCES employees (id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    project_id INT REFERENCES projects (id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    PRIMARY KEY (employee_id, project_id) -- composite primary keys
);
```

### Composite Primary Key
 - A combination of multiple columns can serve as a primary key, this is called composite primary key.
 - In above example, primary key of `employees_projects` is composite primary key.

 ### Composite Foreign Key
 - Composite foreign key is used to connect table with another table which has composite primary key.
 ```sql
FOREIGN KEY (beginningTime, day, tutorId) REFERENCES tutorial(beginningTime, day, tutorId);
 ```

 ### Self Referential Relationships
**One to Many (1:n)**
 - One manager can have multiple employees in his team.

    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE employees (
        id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
        name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
        manager_id INT,
        FOREIGN KEY (manager_id) REFERENCES employees ON DELETE SET NULL
    );
    ```

**One to One (1:1)**
 - An employee can have only one mentor, and each mentor can mentor only one employee.

    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE employees (
        id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
        name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
        mentor_id INT UNIQUE,
        FOREIGN KEY (mentor_id) REFERENCES employees ON DELETE SET NULL
    );
    ```

**Many to Many (n:n)**
 - user can have multiple friends and each friend can also have multiple friends.

    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE users (
        id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
        name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL
    );

    CREATE TABLE user_friends (
        user_id INT,
        friend_id INT,
        CHECK (user_id < friend_id), -- to avoid duplication like 25-30 and 30-25, because both have same meaning that 25 and 30 are friends
        PRIMARY KEY (user_id, friend_id),
        FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users ON DELETE CASCADE,
        FOREIGN KEY (friend_id) REFERENCES users ON DELETE CASCADE
    );
    ```

### UNION

- UNION is a clause that combines multiple result sets into one result set by appending rows.

    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM users WHERE id < 3
    UNION
    SELECT * FROM users WHERE id > 5;

    -- If record is from another table then also it will combine the result sets
    --EX:

    SELECT id, first_name FROM users
    UNION
    SELECT id, street FROM addresses; -- It will add street name in first_name column
    ```

### Joining Data (Inner Join, Left Join, Cross Join)

<table>
<tr>
    <th>addresses</th>
    <th>users</th>
    <th>cities</th>
</tr>
<tr><td>

| id | street | house_number | city_id |
| -- | ------ | ------------ | ------- |
| 1 | Test street | 10A | 1 |
| 2 | Some street | 5 | 2 |
| 3 | My street | 18 | 3 |

</td><td>

| id | first_name | address_id |
| -- | ---------- | ---------- |
| 1 | Max | 1 |
| 2 | Manuel | 3 |

</td><td>

| id | name |
| -- | ---- |
| 1 | my city |
| 2 | test city |
| 3 | dummy city |

</td></tr>
</table>

- **INNER JOIN:** It will display the records that have matching values in both tables.

    ```sql
    -- Combined multiple inner joins (Output of first inner join will behave as a left table for second inner join)
    SELECT u.first_name, a.street, a.house_number, c.name AS city_name
    FROM users AS u
    INNER JOIN addresses AS a ON u.address_id = a.id
    INNER JOIN cities AS c ON a.city_id = c.id;
    ```

    **Output:**

    | first_name | street | house_number | city_name |
    | --------- | ------ | ------------- | --------- |
    | Max | Test street | 10A | my city |
    | Manuel | My street | 18 | dummy city |

- **LEFT JOIN (or LEFT OUTER JOIN):** It will display all records from the first table, and the matched records from the second table.

    ```sql
    SELECT u.first_name, a.street, a.house_number, c.name AS city_name
    FROM addresses AS a
    LEFT JOIN users AS u ON a.id = u.address_id
    INNER JOIN cities AS c ON a.city_id = c.id;
    ```

    **Output:**

    | first_name | street | house_number | city_name |
    | --------- | ------ | ------------- | --------- |
    | Max | Test street | 10A | my city |
    | NULL | Some street | 5 | test city |
    | Manuel | My street | 18 | dummy city |

- **CROSS JOIN:** It will combine every row from the first table with every row from the second table

    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM users
    CROSS JOIN addresses;
    ```

- **SELF JOIN:** Table is joined with itself. It is useful when you want to compare rows within the same table.
    - We can achieve Self Join using Left Join the table with it self.

    ```sql
    SELECT e1.name AS employee_name, e2.name AS manager_name
    FROM employees e1
    LEFT JOIN employees e2 ON e1.manager_id = e2.employee_id;
    ```

- **FULL JOIN:** MySQL Does not support Full Join but we can achieve it using Union. (FULL JOIN = LEFT JOIN UNION RIGHT JOIN)
    ```sql
    SELECT u.first_name, a.street, a.house_number, c.name AS city_name
    FROM addresses AS a
    LEFT JOIN users AS u ON a.id = u.address_id
    INNER JOIN cities AS c ON a.city_id = c.id;

    UNION

    SELECT u.first_name, a.street, a.house_number, c.name AS city_name
    FROM addresses AS a
    RIGHT JOIN users AS u ON a.id = u.address_id
    INNER JOIN cities AS c ON a.city_id = c.id;
    ```

### Aggregate Functions (COUNT, MIN, MAX, SUM, AVG)
- Aggregate functions are functions that perform mathematical operation and return a single (aggregated) result.

- **Count:** The COUNT() function returns the number of records returned by a select query.
    ```sql
    SELECT COUNT(product_id) AS number_of_products FROM products;
    SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT booking_date) FROM bookings;
    ```

- **Min:** The MIN() function returns the minimum value in a set of values.
    ```sql
    SELECT MIN(price) AS smallest_price FROM products;
    ```

- **Max:** The MAX() function returns the maximum value in a set of values.
    ```sql
    SELECT MAX(price) AS largest_price FROM products;
    ```

- **Sum:** The SUM() function calculates the sum of a set of values.
    ```sql
    SELECT SUM(quantity) AS total_items_ordered FROM order_details;
    ```

- **Avg:** The AVG() function returns the average value of an expression.
    ```sql
    SELECT AVG(price) AS average_price FROM products;
    ```

- **Round:** The ROUND() function rounds a number to a specified number of decimal places.
    - **Syntax:** ROUND(number, decimals)
    ```sql
    SELECT ROUND(AVG(num_guests), 2) FROM bookings;

    SELECT ROUND(135.375, 2);
    -- Output: 135.38
    ```

### Group By
- The `GROUP BY` statement groups rows that have the same values into summary rows, like "find the number of customers in each country".
- The `GROUP BY` statement is often used with aggregate functions (`COUNT()`, `MIN()`, `MAX()`, `SUM()`, `AVG()`) to group the result-set by one or more columns.
- **Syntax:**
    ```sql
    SELECT column_name(s)
    FROM table_name
    WHERE condition
    GROUP BY column_name(s)
    ORDER BY column_name(s);
    ```

    ```sql
    -- EX: lists the number of customers in each country
    SELECT COUNT(customer_id), country
    FROM customers
    GROUP BY country;
    ```
- Group by multiple columns is say, for example, **GROUP BY column1, column2**. This means placing all the rows with the same values of columns **column 1** and **column 2** in one group.
    ```sql
    -- this count will return the count of records in that group
    SELECT subject, year, Count(*)
    FROM students
    GROUP BY subject, year;
    ```

### HAVING clause (filter grouped data)
- We know that `WHERE` clause is used to place conditions on columns but what if we want to place conditions on groups? This is where the `HAVING` clause comes into use. We can use the `HAVING` clause to filter results based on the conditions applied to grouped data, such as sums, averages or counts.
- we cannot use aggregate functions like `SUM()`, `COUNT()`, `AVG()`, etc., directly in the `WHERE` clause. Instead, we use the `HAVING` clause when we need to filter data based on the result of these aggregate functions.
- **Syntax:**
    ```sql
    SELECT column1, function_name(column2)
    FROM table_name
    WHERE condition
    GROUP BY column1, column2
    HAVING condition
    ORDER BY column1, column2;
    ```
    ```sql
    -- Filter groups whose total salary of all employees exceeds 50000.
    SELECT NAME, SUM(sal) FROM employees
    GROUP BY name
    HAVING SUM(sal)>50000; 
    ```

### Nested Subqueries
```sql
-- EX: 1
SELECT MIN(daily_sum)
FROM (
    SELECT booking_date, SUM(amount_billed) AS daily_sum
    FROM bookings
    GROUP BY booking_date
) AS daily_table;

--Ex: 2
SELECT * 
FROM employees
WHERE department=(SELECT department FROM departments WHERE dept_id=1);

-- Ex: 3
SELECT * 
FROM employees 
WHERE salary < (SELECT avg(salary) from employees)
```

### Window Function
- Using window functions, we can use aggregate functions without reducing rows like grouping. (In `GROUP BY`, it reduces the rows of same group into the single row).
- We can add result of aggregation into new column.
- **Syntax:**
    ```sql
    SELECT column_name1, 
    window_function(column_name2)
    OVER([PARTITION BY column_name1] [ORDER BY column_name3]) AS new_column
    FROM table_name;
    ```
1. Aggregate Window Functions:
    - Aggregate window functions calculate aggregates over a window of rows while retaining individual rows.
    - Aggregate functions: `COUNT()`, `MIN()`, `MAX()`, `SUM()`, `AVG()`
    - EX:
        ```sql
        SELECT name, age, department, salary,
        AVG(salary) OVER(PARTITION BY department) AS avg_salary
        FROM employees;
        -- Output: (records with same department belongs to single window)
        -- it will add column named avg_salary in which the average value of its window is stored in that column
        ```

2.  Ranking Window Functions:
    - These functions provide rankings of rows within a partition based on specific criteria.
    - Ranking Functions:
        - `RANK()`: Assigns ranks to rows, skipping ranks for duplicates.
            - EX:
                ```sql
                SELECT name, department, salary,
                    RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY department ORDER BY salary DESC) AS emp_rank
                FROM employees;
                -- output
                -- name     | department    | salary | emp_rank
                -- -------------------------------------
                -- Ramesh   | Finance       | 50,000 | 1
                -- Suresh   | Finance       | 50,000 | 1
                -- Ram      | Finance       | 20,000 | 3
                -- Deep     | Sales         | 30,000 | 1
                -- Pradeep  | Sales         | 20,000 | 2

                -- Note:  For Ram, rank is 3 because rank for Suresh has been skipped (i.e. rank 2 is skipped). And rank from Deep will start from 1 because new window is stated (window for sales is started).
                ```
        - `DENSE_RANK()`: Assigns ranks to rows without skipping rank numbers for duplicates.
            - EX:
            ```sql
            SELECT name, department, salary,
                DENSE_RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY department ORDER BY salary DESC) AS emp_dense_rank
            FROM employees;
            -- output
            -- name     | department    | salary | emp_dense_rank
            -- -------------------------------------
            -- Ramesh   | Finance       | 50,000 | 1
            -- Suresh   | Finance       | 50,000 | 1
            -- Ram      | Finance       | 20,000 | 2
            -- Deep     | Sales         | 30,000 | 1
            -- Pradeep  | Sales         | 20,000 | 2

            -- Note: For Ram, rank is 2 because rank for suresh is not skipped.
            ```
        - `ROW_NUMBER()`: Assigns a unique number to each row in the result set.
            - EX:
            ```sql
            SELECT name, department, salary,
                ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY department ORDER BY salary DESC) AS emp_row_no
            FROM employees;
            -- output
            -- name     | department    | salary | emp_row_no
            -- -------------------------------------
            -- Ramesh   | Finance       | 50,000 | 1
            -- Suresh   | Finance       | 50,000 | 2
            -- Ram      | Finance       | 20,000 | 3
            -- Deep     | Sales         | 30,000 | 1
            -- Pradeep  | Sales         | 20,000 | 2
            ```
